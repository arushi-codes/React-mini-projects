# 🚀 React Mini Projects  

A collection of **small, focused React.js projects** I’m building to sharpen my frontend skills.  
Each project covers a **specific React concept** (state, props, hooks, forms, API calls, etc.) in a **hands-on, practical** way.  

---


Each project is self-contained with its own:  
- `README.md`  
- `package.json`  
- `src/` (source files)  

---

## 🔥 Projects Included  

- ✅ **Counter App** – basics of `useState`  
- ✅ **Todo List** – state management, forms, and list rendering  
- ✅ **Weather App** – API fetching with `useEffect`  
- ✅ **Custom Hooks** – reusability patterns  

*(More coming soon 🚧)*
